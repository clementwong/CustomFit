	The problem that I am solving is allowing people to imagine clothing onto their bodies, in particular, designed T-shirts. 
To tackle this program, I built a module that allows users to design t-shirts and another module that simulates the designed
tshirts onto the user.  
	In the application  that allows users to design T-shirts, users are able change the tshirt color and 
add things such as Textboxes and images. The key challenge in this part of the program is to remember how the user designs their
tshirt. The program needs to remember how the user changes details about the tshirt color, textboxes, and images as
they are the key features that define the unique tshirt. For each image for example, the details that need to be 
remembered would be the image content, the position of where the image relative to the tshirt, and the dimensions. For textboxes,
the details would be the textbox's text, font, color, position relative to the tshirt, and dimensions. Only by remembering how the 
user changes the data and designs their tshirt will the program be able to provide a simulation of that unique tshirt.  
	Once the users want to try on their designed tshirt, the program will transfer all of the important details remembered 
in the design t-shirt module to the module that simulates the designed tshirts. The Kinect Module will get
the dimensions of the user's body and will reconfigure the the details transfered
from the design program. The Kinect Module will then use the data manipulated according to the body' dimensions and 
be able to provide a simulation of how the tshirt would look according to the user's body.

My CMU 15-112 Term Project is CustomFit, an application that uses Pygame and PyKinectV2 to allow users to design T-shirts and
provide a simulation to users of how their designed T-shirts would look onto their bodies. Users are first brought a page where
they can design their tshirt by changing the color of the tshirt and adding text and images onto the tshirt. Once the user wants to 
try on their design, they can click on the "Try It On" button where the program will use Microsoft Kinnect
to simulate their design onto the user's body. The user will be able move around and rotate with the simulation. If the user
wants to go back to the main page, all they need to do is put one of their hands where the back arrow is. If they go back to main
page, the user will be able to continue editing, save their design, or open past saved designs.   

In order to use CustomFit, users must install Python 3.4, Kinect for Windows SDK v2 (PyKinectV2), and PyGame.

To run CustomFit, the users will only need to run FinalTP.py. Once they run it, they will be brought to the program and be 
able to start.
